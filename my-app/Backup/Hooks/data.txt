For class Component to update state 
We need This.setstate()
Auto merge option is available


For Functional Component To update the state 
We need Hooks
Auto Merge option is nit available - That's why we have to use Spread operator


1. useState()   - To update the state value
We need to import useState
import React,{useState} from 'react'
 => useState() always returns one destructured array
 => Ex:- let [] = useState()
 => Ex 1:- let [variable,setvariable] = useState()

 => variable is storing content
 => setvariable is a function used to update the variable content


2. useDispatch() - To disptach an action from view

import useDispatch() from 'react-redux'
